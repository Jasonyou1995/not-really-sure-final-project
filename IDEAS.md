# PUSH IDEAS HERE

## Jason:

1. Find the **corelation coefficients** of interesting variable pairs, and then visualize (compare) the differences between these variables.
2. Get the longitude and latitude from Google Map API, and then visualize it on the world map (grouped and colored scatter plot):
	3. Use the count to color different countries;
	4. Lable each dot with the name, rank, and some other useful information
	5. _If using Shiny App_: use widgets that allow users to choose from different ranks
	6. _Consider to use the school_and_country_table_
6. Visualize the regression lines (can be non-linear) and confidence interval for the scatter plot (by scatterD3 or ggplot2 + plotly) with x = universities, y = some_variables_from_dataset.
7. _ShanghaiData_: group by year, and Visualize the trent for the choosed University (by showing the regression line and ranking changes)
8. Sorting the data by different variables and then visualize all of theses rankings (can be grouped by one Shiny app)
