## Motivation:

The target user of this World University Visualization is students, parents, or researchers who are interested in the distributions and surrounding environment of top Universities in the world.

What makes this visualization special is that people can compare the Universities both numerically (the scoring and some other parameters) and geometrically, and this allows users easily get a more comprehensive understanding of what role each University plays in their community.
